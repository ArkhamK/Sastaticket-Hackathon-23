# Sastaticket-Hackathon-23
Submission by Team September for the Sastaticket.pk Hackathon 23. Our problem was problem number 8.

Problem Statement 8 is: 
Unfortunately, a limited number of visa-free destinations are available for Pakistanis. Pakistanis are also unaware of these and other destinations where they can get visa on arrivals (with their passport or existing valid visas on their passports). Your challenge is to help Pakistanis discover such destinations and help them to attain these visas in as frictionless a way as possible.
