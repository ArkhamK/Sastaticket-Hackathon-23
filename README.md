# Sastaticket-Hackathon-23
Submission by my Team "September" for the Sastaticket.pk Hackathon 23. Our problem was problem number 8.

Problem Statement 8 is: 
"Unfortunately, a limited number of visa-free destinations are available for Pakistanis. Pakistanis are also unaware of these and other destinations where they can get visa on arrivals (with their passport or existing valid visas on their passports). Your challenge is to help Pakistanis discover such destinations and help them to attain these visas in as frictionless a way as possible."

Our project is a website that would help visitors be educated about the visa-free destinations and how they work, and also help them book tickets and hotels while providing them news of countries around the world. We planned on making it recommend content based on user profile, but time limitations didn't allow us to do that. We also implemented OCR to read documents provided by the user. Need to implement APIs from Sastaticket.pk and Airbnb as well, which we couldn't because both were having issues from the source.
